			<h2>General information</h2>
				<p>The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning "large foot"). 
				In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, 
				as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo.
				</p>

			<h2>More information</h2>
				<p>As with the terms "wallaroo" and "wallaby", "kangaroo" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species. 
				All three refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size. 
				The largest species in the family are called "kangaroos" and the smallest are generally called "wallabies". 
				The term "wallaroos" refers to species of an intermediate size. There are also the tree-kangaroos.
				</p>
				
				<p>Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. 
				Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.
				The large kangaroos have adapted much better than the smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes 
				brought to the Australian landscape by humans.
				Wild kangaroos are shot for meat, leather hides, and to protect grazing land. Although controversial, kangaroo meat has perceived health 
				benefits for human consumption compared with traditional meats due to the low level of fat on kangaroos.
