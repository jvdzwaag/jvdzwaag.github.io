		<h1>Hello Koalas</h1>
		
			<p>The koala is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. 
			The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's <br>
			eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. <br>
			It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. <br>
			The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm and weighs 4–15 kg. Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown.
			</p>
		 
			<p>Koalas eat a variety of eucalypt leaves and a few other related tree species, including lophostemon, 
			melaleuca and corymbia <br>
			species (such as brush box, paperbark and bloodwood trees). Koalas can sleep for up to 20 hours a day, 
			due to their low energy diet, <br>
			and the intense amount of energy required to break down toxic leaves. 
			Koalas are mostly active at night (nocturnal) and around dawn and dusk. <br>
			However, they can be seen moving during the day if they are disturbed, get too hot or 
			cold, or need to find a new tree.
